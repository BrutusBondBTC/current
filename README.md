In order to give a consistent user experience across mobile devices, we built it on React Native. Current will work in two modes: base and expert. We built the app with base mode features, which offers numerous features for new users right out of the box.

#### Base mode:
For normal users who are used to twitter/facebook like experience where the App manages their keys, lightning wallet, multimedia storage and automated relay management

#### Expert mode:
For power and technical users who are experienced in managing their keys, pay invoices using any lightning wallet and ability to add/manage their own relays.


## Features

Base mode features are currently built and available on the app.

#### Secure Key Management:
Current app utilizes Bitcoinâ€™s BIP-39 seed words to create a human-readable backup for nostr keys. This helps users to store them securely on the device and easily backup on industry standard hardware wallets.

#### Lightning Wallet:
One of the best use cases we have seen of users using the Nostr client is to send and receive sats. However many users struggle with using separate lightning wallets to pay for invoices. So we built a lightning wallet inside the app with which users can send and receive sats with a click of a button.

#### Media storage management:
Over 80% of social media posts are with images and videos. Users will be able to upload images and later videos directly within the app and share their experiences with their community. Uploaded images are scanned for inappropriate content and rejected immediately.

#### Automated Relay management:
App automatically scans and connects to appropriate relays suited for users to send and receive posts. Users do not need to pay for relays or manually configure them.

#### One address for NIP-05 and Lightning:
To make it easier for users, we let them choose a single verified address to send and receive messages and send and receive sats. We also have choices on domain names such as current.tips, current.fyi

#### Import your Twitter follows:
To provide the best user experience, users will be able to port their twitter followers when they set up their profile and right away join the conversations by scrolling through the feeds on their home feed. Users will also be able to search by Nostr public key or NIP-05 address or twitter handle to find new users to follow.

#### No Global view:
Global feed is overwhelmed by in-appropriate messages and unrelated messages which will not serve any purpose for the users. Instead, users will be able to have active conversations within their follower network and expand the network by adding new and interesting people they want to interact with.

#### One click Zaps

Easily share sats by pressing the zap button. You can preset the amount of zaps to be sent each time you press the button. Or long press to set a custom amount. It is that easy.

#### Already implemented NIPs

NIP-01: Basic protocol flow

NIP-05: Mapping Nostr keys to DNS-based internet identifiers

NIP-19: bech32-encoded entities

#### To be implemented:

NIP-08: Mentions

NIP-10: Reply conventions

NIP-12: Generic tag queries (hashtags)

#### Expert Mode:

Once base features are implemented we will start to open up the default features such as wallet, storage and relay management so that expert users will be able to set their own wallets, storage and relays.

## Roadmap

Our goal is to "Build a sustainable micro app economy of the future" on the Nostr protocol. Micro App developers will be able to directly build and provide services to end users. Once the base features of the app are stable, we will start to expand our micro economy. We can't wait to see what features will be built on it. Think of iMessage App extensions but super charged and supported by lightning payments.

Find the architecture we have in mind.
